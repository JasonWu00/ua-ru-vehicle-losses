BEH3;Belgium;09/04/2022;Humanitarian;Assistance;"On April 9, during the event ""Stand Up for Ukraine"", the Belgian Prime Minister announced that Belgium had set up a fund of 800 million EUR to support Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees. Since only 83 million EUR will be sent to Ukraine (see ""Sorce of Aid 2""), we previously reported this amount. On January 2023, the Belgian foreign ministry's official press release stated that 77 million EUR were spent on civilian assistance in 2022 (Source of aid 3). Thus, we assume that the initial 83 million EUR was a reserved budget for aid to Ukraine, and the Belgian government spent 77 million EUR from this value. Moreover, among the 77 million EUR listed, 10 million EUR were spent to help export grain and 6.4 million EUR to different human rights protection organizations, which we do not count.

In September 2022, during an interview with Spiegel, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki stated that Poland donated 300 tanks in total (Source of aid 2). Since Poland previously donated 240 T-72 tanks and yet an unknown amount of PT-91 Twardy, we assume, based on this statement, that the amount of PT-91 donated is 60. Later in February, Polish Prime Minister stated the different amount of tanks donated, which was ""250 tanks... or even more than that"" (Source of aid 3). Since there is no other official source, we have to rely on the most recent information, which is 250 total tanks provided in total. We also assume that ""even more"" could not refer to a critical amount and thus stick to 250. Therefore, we decrease the amount of PT-91 to 10 (250-240).
