When was the last time you thought about the war in Ukraine?

Have you, between 24 February 2022 and now, seen or heard any of these statements?
* The Kyiv offensive is a feint
* The Kharkiv / Kherson battles are futile gestures, Russia has lost nothing at all
* Russia has destroyed 60 HIMARS (or some other large number of Western equipment)

If you have heard or seen one or more of these statements, or other similar statements, \
and want to know if any of them are legitimate, the pages listed on the left sidebar \
might provide some useful context.
